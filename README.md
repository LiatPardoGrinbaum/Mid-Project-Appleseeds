Appleseeds Mid Project

This project is my first personal project, in AppleSeeds fullstack development bootcamp.

## Description

The website was built in ReactJS and it will be a place for people from my town to add posts and share information about free public fruit trees or herbal plants, and for people who have private trees in their garden, to share for free their agricultural products.  
The site was written in hebrew so it can serve people in Pardes Hana Karkur , Israel.

There are two main ways to share that information:

1. The Forum page which is the page people can write posts. There's an option to log in with google and then you can also delete or update your post, as well as to write it as anonymous (and then you can't delete or update it).
2. Google Map platform. Anyone can enter the Map page to add markers of locations and edit them with information.

In this project I implemented the following subjects:

- CRUD
- API Calls
- Routes
- hooks
- google login
- react google map/api library

## How did I get the idea for this project?

I started thinking about a project which will have a positive impact on my environment and the local community. I got the idea from my husband as we both share the love of finding some free public trees or herbs that we can collect. I also asked in my neighborhood WhatsApp group for ideas and got the same idea from my neighbor Ruth. Then I realise it might be a real need!

## Challenges I faced:

The most challenging part for me was to work with the google cloud platform (google map library which was new to me, as well as the google login platform).

## Last words...

I have learned a lot from this project, and also had the chance to implement the new subjects I have learned in the course, such as Hooks in functional components.  
I hope it will indeed be in use by people from my community.
